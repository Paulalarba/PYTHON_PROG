#Dynamic typing in python it means you can re assign the variable as many as you want example:

name = "Paul"
name = 8
name = ["Paul", "Alarba"]
# the output of the code should be the list
print(name)
# but the dynamic typing is not advisable because it is unpradictable

# type casting a variable in python can be converted using type castting

age = 20.2
age = int(age)
print(age)

first_name = "12.12"
first_name = int(first_name)
print(first_name) #this is not valid type casting since you cant convert a string to number
